    # Set the number of symbols (i.e. the generation size in RLNC terminology)
    # and the size of a symbol in bytes

    # The perpetual encoder supports three operation modes;
    #
    # 1) Random pivot mode (default)
    #    The pivot element is drawn at random for each coding symbol
    #
    #    example generated vectors (for width = 2)
    #
    #    0 0 1 X X 0
    #    X X 0 0 0 1
    #    X 0 0 0 1 X
    #    X X 0 0 0 1
    #    0 1 X X 0 0
    #    0 1 X X 0 0
    #
    #    1 X X 0 0 0
    #    0 0 0 1 X X
    #         .
    #         .
    #
    # 2) Pseudo systematic
    #    Pivot elements are generated with indices 0,1,2, ... , n,
    #    after which the generator reverts to the default random pivot
    #
    #    example generated vectors (for width = 2)
    #
    #    1 X X 0 0 0
    #    0 1 X X 0 0
    #    0 0 1 X X 0
    #    0 0 0 1 X X
    #    X 0 0 0 1 X
    #    X X 0 0 0 1
    #
    #    (additional vectors generated using the random mode)
    #
    # 3) Pre-charging
    #    For the first "width" symbols, the pivot index is 0. After that,
    #    the pseudo-systematic mode is used. Finally, pivots are drawn at
    #    random resulting in the indices 0 (width times), 1,2, ... , n
    #
    #    example generated vectors (for width = 2)
    #
    #    1 X X 0 0 0
    #    1 X X 0 0 0
    #    0 1 X X 0 0

    # pre-charging and pseudo-systematic is enabled, pre-charging takes
    # precedence.
